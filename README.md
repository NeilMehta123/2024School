Hello comrades this is isahtx and this readme is just some rules and extra stuff that you might wanna read
First rule: please do not copy the html, css and js  without permission or crediting 
Second rule: Im not responsible for what you do on this website, if you get caught using this at school or anything like that i am not responsible in anyway, I have tried to make it invisible to teachers as much as possible with stuff like the title being schoology and the favicon being the schoolgy icon (although please use in like break times, if ur in middle of class please acually do your work and listen to the teacher.
Third rule: if you need help or anything or questions from me please feel free to ask me and if i have some free time I will try my best to answer you best as possible :)
you may absoloutly copy the shadows,native, and binbash folders as those are the games and they are not mine. (credit the og makers tho)
